### The Phonology of Modern Standard Chinese Syllable Finals

This is a scan of my 1994 thesis, *The Phonology of Modern Standard Chinese Syllable Finals*.

Unfortunately, back in the day i wrote this piece using MS Word running on German and Chinese
MS Windows. I used MS Backup to save everything to sets of floppy disks, not being aware
that while MS Backup does write to magnetic media, those media and the OS were destined to become 'legacy'
software very soon. For this reason, the best i can offer now are PDFs with scans of the printed pages.

The thesis may be downloaded as
[pamhc.pdf](https://github.com/loveencounterflow/phonologie-auslaute-chinesisch/releases/download/tr1/pamhc.pdf); it covers the finals of Mandarin. An hitherto unpublished
annex draft covering the initials (i.e. the consonants) of Mandarin is available as
[consonants.pdf](https://github.com/loveencounterflow/phonologie-auslaute-chinesisch/releases/download/tr1/consonants.pdf).


The upload of this material was triggered by an
[interesting discussion on Language Log](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=17913).

In the following, i started to collect some snippets from that discussion that i try to connect to
details i treated in my thesis.

> Both are valid phonemicizations. You can't decide between them based on what you hear. Even if you agree
> that 音 is pronounced [in], you can still treat this phonemically as /iən/ -> [in].

> One possible way of deciding between the phonemicizations is by looking at rhyming. The problem with this is

> so judgments of zhuyin users and pinyin users might differ. Still, you can ask some native speakers which
> subsets of the following four characters rhyme:
>
> a) 恩
> b) 音
> c) 暈
> d) 溫

> According to the zhuyin representation, all four have the same main vowel and ending (ㄣ) so they should all
> rhyme. According to the (base) pinyin representation (a) and (d) should rhyme with each other, and nothing
