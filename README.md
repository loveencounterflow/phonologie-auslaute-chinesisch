### The Phonology of Modern Standard Chinese Syllable Finals

This is a scan of my 1994 thesis, *The Phonology of Modern Standard Chinese Syllable Finals*.

Unfortunately, back in the day i wrote this piece using MS Word running on German and Chinese
MS Windows. I used MS Backup to save everything to sets of floppy disks, not being aware
that while MS Backup does write to magnetic media, those media and the OS were destined to become 'legacy'
software very soon. For this reason, the best i can offer now are PDFs with scans of the printed pages.

The thesis may be downloaded as
[pamhc.pdf](https://github.com/loveencounterflow/phonologie-auslaute-chinesisch/releases/download/tr1/pamhc.pdf); it covers the finals of Mandarin. An hitherto unpublished
annex draft covering the initials (i.e. the consonants) of Mandarin is available as
[consonants.pdf](https://github.com/loveencounterflow/phonologie-auslaute-chinesisch/releases/download/tr1/consonants.pdf).


The upload of this material was triggered by an
[interesting discussion on Language Log](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=17913).

In the following, i started to collect some snippets from that discussion that i try to connect to
details i treated in my thesis.

@Michael Watts Concering a phonological vowel model for MSC, that would hinge a lot on assumptions of
syllabic structure. One model is to postulate that all syllables in the language must have the same
structure (eg **OMNC** for Onset, Medial, Nucleus, and Coda) and then demand that all syllables that do
not display the full possible complexity (as e.g. found in shuai, tiao, liang) should have "zero"
placeholders in the missing positions.

Another, complementary view is to say that auditorily simple syllables should be analyzed as
having phonological simple structures, and auditorily complex syllables should be analyzed as having
correspondongly more phonological structure. I think the latter approach is much better for a number of
reasons.

That said, let's have a look at all the minimal, short, simple syllables of Mandarin. Since we are
here only concerned with the "vowels", we can allow syllables with occupied (consonantal) onsets next
to ones with zero (vocalic) onsets.

Possible candidates for minimal syllable finals of Mandarin are, among others:

ge, yi, yu, la, (ai)yo!, er, wu, ri, zhi, si.

Of these, we can discount the yo because it is clearly an interjection, and we know that while interjections
are not at all uninteresting in themselves, they often obey phonetic / phonological rules that are not
valid for the words you would "expect to find in the dictionary" (i.e. the "main system" of the language).

Next, er on the one hand and ri, zhi, shi on the other are special.

Er is special because it cannot appear
with an onset except in rhotacized syllables (兒化音節). I think 兒化 should be dealt with separately. As for
the stand-alone syllable er, we can advantageously deal with it later.

Ri, zhi, shi are special because in this case, the vowel cannot combine with any medial or coda (outside
of beign rhotacized). The vowel is also perceptually quite salient and not very [i]-ish as the Pinyin
orthography would have one to believe. If what i said above is true, we can safely surmise that whatever
is written "i" in these syllables forms its own sub-system. At any rate, we wanted to take a look
at the minimal syllables of Mandarin, and these syllables are not, because the realization of the
the syllable finals relies on these specific onsets being present.

We're left with 5 distinct single vowels in Mandarin; these are /a/, /ɤ/, /i/, /ü/, and /u/.

To make a long answer short: Once we leave the realm of single-segment finals and have a look
into more complex syllables, the pattern that emerges is that one set of complex finals (e.g. as in
liang, xian, guai, lao, dang) has something very [a]-ish in its nucleus, and **we are almost
always able to find a minimally different companion syllable with a distinctly not
[a]-ish nucleus**; as for the examples shown above, the companion pairs are

* liang — ling
* xian — xin
* guai — gui
* lao — lou
* dang — deng

It doesn't end there: It looks like **you can never find a third companion syllable in Mandarin that
would be only distinguished by its nucleus**; thus, there is no \*lieng that is distinct from ling, liang,
no \*lien that is distinct from lin, lian and so on.

@Michael Watts concerning the vowels of la, le, li, lu, lü etc and the "two vowels" model, the short answer
to me is that these syllables have a simpler structure that syllables like lai, lei, lou, lüe and so on.

The effect is that in the simpler syllables, you have more options to put into the single available position
(in Mandarin, at least five), while in the complex syllables, what you gain in complexity by adding more
positions to the syllable final is in part counteracted by a reduction in what each position can
accommodate. In complex finals, the medial position can only have i, u, ü; the code can only have i, u, n,
or ng, and the nucleus one of *two* possibilities: a and "not a".

Two considerations corroborate these findings: (1) we find that when we look at consonant clusters across
languages, those clusters do enlarge the overall range of possible utterances, but the price to pay for the
added complexity is that not all consonants can partake in all clusters; rather, the number of clusters is
typically quite reduced. This is in analogy to what we find in MSC finals. (2) When we compare moderately
complex with maximally complex Mandarin syllable finals, we find more restrictions in the latter: for
example, you only get one "i" and one "u" per syllable, and in a syllable with a medial "ü", neither "i" nor
"u" may appear in the coda.
