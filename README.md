### The Phonology of Modern Standard Chinese Syllable Finals

This is a scan of my 1994 thesis, *The Phonology of Modern Standard Chinese Syllable Finals*.

Unfortunately, back in the day i wrote this piece using MS Word running on German and Chinese
MS Windows. I used MS Backup to save everything to sets of floppy disks, not being aware
that while MS Backup does write to magnetic media, those media and the OS were destined to become 'legacy'
software very soon. For this reason, the best i can offer now are PDFs with scans of the printed pages.

The thesis may be downloaded as
[pamhc.pdf](https://github.com/loveencounterflow/phonologie-auslaute-chinesisch/releases/download/tr1/pamhc.pdf); it covers the finals of Mandarin. An hitherto unpublished
annex draft covering the initials (i.e. the consonants) of Mandarin is available as
[consonants.pdf](https://github.com/loveencounterflow/phonologie-auslaute-chinesisch/releases/download/tr1/consonants.pdf).
